canary.txt is a proposed standard which allows websites to define security policies. The canary.txt file sets clear guidelines for security researchers on how to report security issues. canary.txt is the equivalent of `robots.txt`, but for security issues.

> ‚Äú When security vulnerabilities are discovered by researchers, proper reporting channels are often lacking.  As a result, vulnerabilities may be left unreported.  This document defines a format ("canary.txt") to help organizations describe their vulnerability disclosure practices to make it easier for researchers to report vulnerabilities.‚Äù
