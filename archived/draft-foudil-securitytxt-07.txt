Abstract

   When security vulnerabilities are discovered by independent security
   researchers, they often lack the channels to report them properly.
   As a result, security vulnerabilities may be left unreported.  This
   document defines a format ("canary.txt") to help organizations
   describe the process for security researchers to follow in order to
   report security vulnerabilities.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation and Prior Work

   Many security researchers encounter situations where they are unable
   to report security vulnerabilities to organizations because there is
   no course of action laid out or no way indicated to contact the owner
   of a particular resource.

   As per section 4 of [RFC2142], there is an existing convention of
   using the <SECURITY@domain> email address for communications
   regarding security vulnerabilities.  That convention provides only a
   single, email-based channel of communication for security
   vulnerabilities per domain, and does not provide a way for domain
   owners to publish information about their security disclosure
   policies.

   There are also contact conventions prescribed for Internet Service
   Providers (ISPs) in section 2 of [RFC3013], for Computer Security
   Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) in section 3.2 of [RFC2350] and for
   site operators in section 5.2 of [RFC2196].  As per [RFC7485], there
   is also contact information provided by Regional Internet Registries
   (RIRs) and domain registries for owners of IP addresses, autonomous
   system numbers (ASNs) and domain names.  However, none of these
   address the issue of how security researchers can locate disclosure
   policies and contact information for organizations in order to report
   security vulnerabilities.

   In this document, we define a richer, machine-parsable and more
   extensible way for organizations to communicate information about
   their security disclosure policies, which is not limited to email and
   also allows for additional features such as encryption.  This format
   is designed to help assist with the security disclosure process by
   making it easier for organizations to designate the preferred steps
   for researchers to take when trying to reach out to them with
   security vulnerabilities.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Note to Readers

      *Note to the RFC Editor:* Please remove this section prior to
      publication.

   Development of this draft takes place on Github at:
   https://github.com/canarytxt/canary-txt

3.  The Specification

   This document defines a text file to be placed in a known location
   that provides information for security researchers to assist in
   disclosing security vulnerabilities.

   The file is named "canary.txt", and this file SHOULD be placed
   under the /.well-known/ path ("/.well-known/canary.txt") [RFC8615]
   of a domain name or IP address for web properties.  If it is not
   possible to place the canary.txt file in the /.well-known/ path or
   setup a redirect, web-based services MAY place the file in the top-
   level path of a given web domain or IP address ("/canary.txt") as a
   fallback option (see Section 4.1).

   For web-based services, the file MUST be accessible via the Hypertext
   Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC1945] as a resource of Internet Media
   Type "text/plain" with the default charset parameter set to "utf-8"
   per section 4.1.3 of [RFC2046], and it MUST be served with "https"
   (as per section 2.7.2 of [RFC7230]).  For file systems and version
   control repositories a "canary.txt" file SHOULD be placed in the
   root directory of a particular file system or source code project.

   This text file contains multiple directives with different values.
   The "directive" is the first part of a field all the way up to the
   colon ("Contact:") and follows the syntax defined for "field-name" in
   section 3.6.8 of [RFC5322].  Directives MUST be case-insensitive (as
   per section 2.3 of [RFC5234]).  The "value" comes after the directive
   ("https://example.com/security") and follows the syntax defined for
   "unstructured" in section 3.2.5 of [RFC5322].

   A "field" MUST always consist of a directive and a value ("Contact:
   https://example.com/security").  A canary.txt file can have an

Internet-Draft     A Method for Web Security Policies          July 2019


   unlimited number of fields.  It is important to note that you MUST
   have a separate line for every field.  One MUST NOT chain multiple
   values for a single directive unless it is explicitly defined by that
   particular field.  Unless otherwise indicated in a definition of a
   particular field, any directive MAY appear multiple times.

3.1.  Scope

   A "canary.txt" file MUST only apply to the domain in the URI used
   to retrieve it, not to any of its subdomains or parent domains.  A
   "canary.txt" file that is found in a file system or version control
   repository MUST only apply to the folder or repository in which it is
   located, and not to any of its parent or sibling folders, or
   repositories.  However, it will apply to all subfolders.

   Some examples appear below:

   # The following only applies to example.com.
   https://example.com/.well-known/canary.txt

   # This only applies to subdomain.example.com.
   https://subdomain.example.com/.well-known/canary.txt

   # This canary.txt file applies to IPv4 address of 192.0.2.0.
   https://192.0.2.0/.well-known/canary.txt

   # This canary.txt file applies to IPv6 address of 2001:db8:8:4::2.
   https://[2001:db8:8:4::2]/.well-known/canary.txt

   # This file applies to the /example/folder1 directory and subfolders.
   /example/folder1/canary.txt

3.2.  Comments

   Any line beginning with the "#" (%x30) symbol MUST be interpreted as
   a comment.  The content of the comment may contain any ASCII or
   Unicode characters in the %x21-7E and %x80-FFFFF ranges plus the tab
   (%x09) and space (%x20) characters.

   Example:

   # This is a comment.

   You MAY use one or more comments as descriptive text immediately
   before the field.  Parsers SHOULD associate the comments with the
   respective field.  Only the line most immediately preceding a field
   SHOULD be associated with that field.

Internet-Draft     A Method for Web Security Policies          July 2019


3.3.  Separate Fields

   A separate line is REQUIRED for every new field.  You MUST NOT chain
   everything into a single field unless defined by that field.  Every
   line MUST end either with a carriage return and line feed characters
   (CRLF / %x0D %x0A) or just a line feed character (LF / %x0A).

3.4.  Digital signature

   It is RECOMMENDED that a canary.txt file be digitally signed using
   an OpenPGP cleartext signature as described in section 7 of
   [RFC4880].  When digital signatures are used, it is also RECOMMENDED
   that implementors use the "Canonical" directive (as per
   Section 3.5.2), thus allowing the digital signature to authenticate
   the location of the file.

   When it comes to verifying the key used to generate the signature, it
   is always the security researcher's responsibility to make sure the
   key being used is indeed one they trust.

3.5.  Field Definitions

3.5.1.  Acknowledgments

   This directive allows you to link to a page where security
   researchers are recognized for their reports.  The page being linked
   to SHOULD list individuals or organizations that reported security
   vulnerabilities and worked with you to remediate the issue.
   Organizations SHOULD be careful to limit the vulnerability
   information being published in order to prevent future attacks.

   If this directive indicates a web URL, then it MUST begin with
   "https://" (as per section 2.7.2 of [RFC7230]).

   Example:

   Acknowledgments: https://example.com/hall-of-fame.html

   Example security acknowledgments page:

   We would like to thank the following researchers:

   (2017-04-15) Frank Denis - Reflected cross-site scripting
   (2017-01-02) Alice Quinn  - SQL injection
   (2016-12-24) John Buchner - Stored cross-site scripting
   (2016-06-10) Anna Richmond - A server configuration issue

3.5.2.  Canonical

   This directive indicates the canonical URI where the canary.txt
   file is located, which is usually something like
   "https://example.com/.well-known/canary.txt".  If this directive
   indicates a web URL, then it MUST begin with "https://" (as per
   section 2.7.2 of [RFC7230]).  The purpose of this directive is to
   allow a digital signature to be applied to the location of the
   "canary.txt" file.

   This directive MUST NOT appear more than once.

   Canonical: https://example.com/.well-known/canary.txt

3.5.3.  Contact

   This directive allows you to provide an address that researchers
   SHOULD use for reporting security vulnerabilities.  The value MAY be
   an email address, a phone number and/or a web page with contact
   information.  The "Contact:" directive MUST always be present in a
   canary.txt file.  If this directive indicates a web URL, then it
   MUST begin with "https://" (as per section 2.7.2 of [RFC7230]).
   Security email addresses SHOULD use the conventions defined in
   section 4 of [RFC2142].

   The value MUST follow the URI syntax described in [RFC3986].  This
   means that "mailto" and "tel" URI schemes MUST be used when
   specifying email addresses and telephone numbers, as defined in
   [RFC6068] and [RFC3966].  When the value of this directive is an
   email address, it is RECOMMENDED that encryption be used (as per
   Section 3.5.4).

   The precedence SHOULD be in listed order.  The first field is the
   preferred method of contact.  In the example below, the email address
   is the preferred method of contact.

   Contact: mailto:security@example.com
   Contact: tel:+1-201-555-0123
   Contact: https://example.com/security-contact.html

3.5.4.  Encryption

   This directive allows you to point to an encryption key that security
   researchers SHOULD use for encrypted communication.  You MUST NOT
   directly add your key to the field, instead the value of this field
   MUST be a URI pointing to a location where the key can be retrieved
   from.  If this directive indicates a web URL, then it MUST begin with
   "https://" (as per section 2.7.2 of [RFC7230]).

   When it comes to verifying the authenticity of the key, it is always
   the security researcher's responsibility to make sure the key being
   specified is indeed one they trust.  Researchers MUST NOT assume that
   this key is used to generate the digital signature referenced in
   Section 3.4.

   Example of an OpenPGP key available from a web server:

   Encryption: https://example.com/pgp-key.txt

   Example of an OpenPGP key available from an OPENPGPKEY DNS record:

Encryption: dns:5d2d37ab76d47d36._openpgpkey.example.com?type=OPENPGPKEY

   Example of an OpenPGP key being referenced by its fingerprint:

   Encryption: openpgp4fpr:5f2de5521c63a801ab59ccb603d49de44b29100f

3.5.5.  Hiring

   The "Hiring" directive is used for linking to the vendor's security-
   related job positions.  If this directive indicates a web URL, then
   it MUST begin with "https://" (as per section 2.7.2 of [RFC7230]).

   Hiring: https://example.com/jobs.html

3.5.6.  Policy

   This directive allows you to link to where your security policy and/
   or disclosure policy is located.  This can help security researchers
   understand what you are looking for and how to report security
   vulnerabilities.  If this directive indicates a web URL, then it MUST
   begin with "https://" (as per section 2.7.2 of [RFC7230]).

   Example:

   Policy: https://example.com/security-policy.html

3.5.7.  Preferred-Languages

   This directive can be used to indicate a set of natural languages
   that are preferred when submitting security reports.  This set MAY
   list multiple values, separated by commas.  If this directive is
   included then at least one value MUST be listed.  The values within
   this set are language tags (as defined in [RFC5646]).  If this
   directive is absent, security researchers MAY assume that English is
   the default language to be used (as per section 4.5 of [RFC2277]).

   The order in which they appear MUST NOT be interpreted as an
   indication of priority - rather these MUST BE interpreted as all
   being of equal priority.

   This directive MUST NOT appear more than once.

   Example (English, Spanish and French):

4.  Location of the canary.txt file

4.1.  Web-based services

   Web-based services SHOULD place the canary.txt file under the
   /.well-known/ path; e.g. https://example.com/.well-known/canary.txt
   as per [RFC8615].  A canary.txt file located under the top-level
   path SHOULD either redirect (as per section 6.4 of [RFC7231]) to the
   canary.txt file under the /.well-known/ path or be used as a
   fallback if the ".well-known" path cannot be used.

   If retrieval of a "canary.txt" file from the top-level path results
   in a redirect (as per section 6.4 of [RFC7231]), the implementors
   MUST NOT follow that redirect if it leads to another domain or
   subdomain but SHOULD follow that redirect within the same domain name
   (but not different subdomain on the same domain).

   The guidance regarding redirects SHOULD NOT apply to the resource
   locations that appear within the file.

4.2.  Filesystems

   File systems SHOULD place the "canary.txt" file under the root
   directory; e.g., "/canary.txt", "C:\canary.txt".

   Example file system:

   /example-directory-1/
   /example-directory-2/
   /example-directory-3/
   /example-file
   /canary.txt

4.3.  Internal hosts

   A "canary.txt" file SHOULD be placed in the root directory of an
   internal host.

4.4.  Extensibility

   Like many other formats and protocols, this format may need to be
   extended over time to fit the ever-changing landscape of the
   Internet.  Therefore, extensibility is provided via an IANA registry
   for directives as defined in Section 7.2.  Any directives registered
   via that process MUST be considered optional.  To encourage
   extensibility and interoperability, implementors MUST ignore any
   fields they do not explicitly support.

Internet-Draft     A Method for Web Security Policies          July 2019


   In general, implementors SHOULD "be conservative in what you do, be
   liberal in what you accept from others" (as per [RFC0793]).

5.  File Format Description and ABNF Grammar

   The expected file format of the canary.txt file is plain text (MIME
   type "text/plain") as defined in section 4.1.3 of [RFC2046] and is
   encoded using UTF-8 [RFC3629] in Net-Unicode form [RFC5198].

   The following is an ABNF definition of the canary.txt format, using
   the conventions defined in [RFC5234].

6.  Security Considerations

   Implementors SHOULD review this section as well as the security
   considerations section of [RFC8615].

6.1.  Compromised Files and Redirects

   An attacker that has compromised a website is able to compromise the
   "canary.txt" file as well or setup a redirect to their own site.
   This can result in security reports not being received by the
   organization or sent to the attacker.

   To protect against this, organizations SHOULD digitally sign their
   "canary.txt" files (as per Section 3.4), use the canonical
   directive to sign the location of the file (as per Section 3.5.2),
   and regularly monitor the file and the referenced resources to detect
   tampering.

   Security researchers SHOULD check the "canary.txt" file including
   verifying the digital signature and checking any available historical
   records before using the information contained in the file.  If
   "canary.txt" file looks suspicious or compromised, it SHOULD NOT be
   used.

   To avoid redirect attacks, redirects for these files MUST NOT be
   followed when the file is placed in the top level path if they lead
   to a different domain (as per Section 4.1).

Internet-Draft     A Method for Web Security Policies          July 2019


6.2.  Incorrect or Stale Information

   If information and resources referenced in a "canary.txt" file are
   incorrect or not kept up to date, this can result in security reports
   not being received by the organization or sent to incorrect contacts,
   thus exposing possible security issues to third parties.

   Organizations SHOULD ensure that information in this file and any
   referenced resources such as web pages, email addresses and telephone
   numbers are kept current, are accessible, controlled by the
   organization, and are kept secure.

6.3.  Intentionally Malformed Files, Resources and Reports

   It is possible for attackers to generate files that are
   extraordinarily large or otherwise malformed in an attempt to
   discover or exploit weaknesses in parsing code.  Implementors SHOULD
   make sure that any such code is robust against large and malformed
   files.  ABNF grammar (as defined in Section 5) SHOULD be used as a
   way to verify these files.

   Same concerns apply to any other resources referenced within
   canary.txt files, as well as any security reports received as a
   result of publishing this file.  Such resources and reports may be
   hostile, malformed or malicious.

6.4.  No Implied Permission for Testing

   The presence of a canary.txt file can be interpreted by researchers
   as providing permission to do security testing against that asset.
   This can lead to increased testing against an organization by
   researchers.  On the other hand, a decision not to publish a
   canary.txt file can be interpreted by the organization operating
   that website to be a way to signal to researchers that permission to
   test that particular site or project is denied.  This can lead to
   pushback against researchers reporting security issues to that
   organization.

   Therefore, implementors MUST NOT assume that presence or absence of a
   "canary.txt" file grants or denies permission for security testing.
   Any such permission MAY be defined in a security or disclosure policy
   (as per Section 3.5.6) or a new directive (as per Section 4.4).

6.5.  Multi-user Environments

   In multi-user / multi-tenant environments, it may possible for a user
   to take over the location of the "canary.txt" file.  Organizations
   SHOULD reserve the "canary.txt" namespace to ensure no third-party



Foudil & Shafranovich   Expires January 22, 2020               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft     A Method for Web Security Policies          July 2019


   can create a page with the "canary.txt" AND "/.well-known/
   canary.txt" names.

6.6.  Protecting Data in Transit

   To protect a "canary.txt" file from being tampered with in transit,
   implementors MUST use HTTPS when serving the file itself and any web
   URLs referenced in it (except as noted in this specification).
   Implementors MUST also perform the correct TLS verification (as per
   [RFC6125]).

   As an additional layer of protection, it is also RECOMMENDED that
   organizations digitally sign their "canary.txt" file with OpenPGP
   (as per Section 3.4).  Also, to protect security reports from being
   tampered with or observed while in transit, organizations SHOULD
   specify encryption keys (as per Section 3.5.4) unless HTTPS is being
   used.

   However, the determination of validity of keys being used is out of
   scope for this specification.  Implementors MUST establish other
   secure means to verify these keys.

6.7.  Spam and Spurious Reports

   Similar to concerns in [RFC2142], denial of service attacks via spam
   reports would become easier once a "canary.txt" file is published
   by an organization.  In addition, there is an increased likelihood of
   reports being sent in an automated fashion and/or as result of
   automated scans without human triage.

   Organizations SHOULD weigh the advantages of publishing this file
   versus the possible disadvantages and increased resources required to
   triage security reports.

   Security researchers SHOULD consult the organization's policy, if
   available, before submitting reports in an automated fashion or as
   resulting from automated scans.

7.  IANA Considerations

   example.com is used in this document following the uses indicated in
   [RFC2606].

   192.0.2.0 and 2001:db8:8:4::2 are used in this document following the
   uses indicated in [RFC6890].

7.1.  Well-Known URIs registry

   The "Well-Known URIs" registry should be updated with the following
   additional values (using the template from [RFC8615]):

   URI suffix: canary.txt

   Change controller: IETF

   Specification document(s): this document

   Status: permanent

7.2.  Registry for canary.txt Header Fields

   IANA is requested to create the "canary.txt Header Fields" registry
   in accordance with [RFC8126].  This registry will contain header
   fields for use in canary.txt files, defined by this specification.

   New registrations or updates MUST be published in accordance with the
   "Expert Review" guidelines as described in section 4.5 of [RFC8126].
   Any new field thus registered is considered optional by this
   specification unless a new version of this specification is
   published.

   New registrations and updates MUST contain the following information:

   1.  Name of the field being registered or updated

   2.  Short description of the field

   3.  Whether the field can appear more than once

   4.  The document in which the specification of the field is published

   5.  New or updated status, which MUST be one of: current: The field
       is in current use deprecated: The field is in current use, but
       its use is discouraged historic: The field is no longer in
       current use

   An update may make a notation on an existing registration indicating
   that a registered field is historical or deprecated if appropriate.

   The initial registry contains these values:
