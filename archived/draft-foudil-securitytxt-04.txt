Abstract

   When security risks are discovered by independent security
   researchers, they often lack the channels to disclose them properly.
   As a result, security issues may be left unreported.  This document
   defines a standard ("canary.txt") to help organizations describe
   the process for security researchers to follow in order to disclose
   security vulnerabilities securely.

Internet-Draft     A Method for Web Security Policies          July 2018


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation and Prior Work

   Many security researchers encounter situations where they are unable
   to responsibly disclose security issues to companies because there is
   no course of action laid out or no way indicated to contact the owner
   of a particular resource.

   As per section 4 of [RFC2142], there is an existing convention of
   using the <SECURITY@domain> email address for communications
   regarding security issues.  That convention provides only a single,
   email-based channel of communication for security issues per domain,
   and does not provide a way for domain owners to publish information
   about their security disclosure policies.

   There are also contact conventions prescribed for Internet Service
   Providers (ISPs) in section 2 of [RFC3013], for Computer Security
   Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) in section 3.2 of [RFC2350] and for
   site operators in section 5.2 of [RFC2196].  As per [RFC7485], there
   is also contact information provided by Regional Internet Registries
   (RIRs) and domain registries for owners of IP addresses, autonomous
   system numbers (ASNs) and domain names.  However, none of these
   address the issue of how security researchers can locate disclosure
   policies and contact information for companies in order to
   responsibly disclose security issues.

   In this document, we define a richer, machine-parsable and more
   extensible way for companies to communicate information about their
   security disclosure policies, which is not limited to email and also
   allows for additional features such as encryption.  This standard is
   designed to help assist with the security disclosure process by
   making it easier for companies to designate the preferred steps for
   researchers to take when trying to reach out to them with security
   issues.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Note to Readers

      *Note to the RFC Editor:* Please remove this section prior to
      publication.

   Development of this draft takes place on Github at:
   https://github.com/canarytxt/canary-txt

   A mailing list is available for discussion at:
   https://www.freelists.org/list/canarytxt

3.  The Specification

   This standard defines a text file to be placed in a known location
   that provides information for security researchers to assist in
   disclosing security issues.

   The file is named "canary.txt", and this file SHOULD be placed
   under the /.well-known/ path ("/.well-known/canary.txt") [RFC5785]
   of a domain name or IP address for web properties.  If it is not
   possible to place the canary.txt file in the /.well-known/ path or
   setup a redirect, web-based services MAY place the file in the top-
   level path of a given web domain or IP address ("/canary.txt") as a
   fall back option.  For web-based services, the instructions MUST be
   accessible via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol [RFC1945] as a
   resource of Internet Media Type "text/plain" with the default charset
   parameter set to "utf-8" per section 4.1.3 of [RFC2046].  For file
   systems and version control repositories a ".canary.txt" file
   SHOULD be placed in the root directory of a particular file system or
   source code project.

   This text file contains multiple directives with different values.
   The "directive" is the first part of a field all the way up to the
   colon ("Contact:").  Directives MUST be case-insensitive.  The
   "value" comes after the directive ("https://example.com/security").
   A "field" MUST alway consist of a directive and a value ("Contact:
   https://example.com/security").  A canary.txt file can have an
   unlimited number of fields.  It is important to note that you MUST
   have a separate line for every field.  One MUST NOT chain multiple
   values for a single directive and everything MUST be in a separate
   field.  Unless otherwise indicated in a definition of a particular
   field, any directive MAY appear multiple times.

3.1.  Scope

   A "canary.txt" file MUST only apply to the domain in the URI used
   to retrieve it, not to any of its subdomains or parent domains.  A
   "canary.txt" file that is found in a file system or version control

Internet-Draft     A Method for Web Security Policies          July 2018


   repository MUST only apply to the folder or repository in which it is
   located, and not to any of its parent or sibling folders, or
   repositories.

   Some examples appear below:

   # The following only applies to example.com.
   https://example.com/.well-known/canary.txt

   # This only applies to subdomain.example.com.
   https://subdomain.example.com/.well-known/canary.txt

   # This canary.txt file applies to IPv4 address of 192.0.2.0.
   http://192.0.2.0/.well-known/canary.txt

   # This canary.txt file applies to IPv6 address of 2001:db8:8:4::2.
   http://[2001:db8:8:4::2]/.well-known/canary.txt

   # This canary.txt file applies to the /example/folder1 directory.
   /example/folder1/canary.txt

3.2.  Comments

   Any line beginning with the "#" (%x30) symbol MUST be interpreted as
   a comment.

   Example:

   # This is a comment.

   You MAY use one or more comments as descriptive text immediately
   before the field.  Parsers SHOULD associate the comments with the
   respective field.

3.3.  Separate Fields

   A separate line is REQUIRED for every new value and field.  You MUST
   NOT chain everything into a single field.  Every line MUST end either
   with a carriage return and line feed characters (CRLF / %x0D %x0A) or
   just a line feed character (LF / %x0A).

3.4.  Field Definitions

3.4.1.  Acknowledgments

   This directive allows you to link to a page where security
   researchers are recognized for their reports.  The page being linked




Foudil & Shafranovich   Expires January 16, 2019                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     A Method for Web Security Policies          July 2018


   to SHOULD list individuals or companies that disclosed security
   vulnerabilities and worked with you to remediate the issue.

   Example:

   Acknowledgments: https://example.com/hall-of-fame.html

   Example security acknowledgments page:

   We would like to thank the following researchers:

   (2017-04-15) Frank Denis - Reflected cross-site scripting
   (2017-01-02) Alice Quinn  - SQL injection
   (2016-12-24) John Buchner - Stored cross-site scripting
   (2016-06-10) Anna Richmond - A server configuration issue

3.4.2.  Contact

   This directive allows you to provide an address that researchers
   SHOULD use for reporting security issues.  The value MAY be an email
   address, a phone number and/or a contact page with more information.
   The "Contact:" directive MUST always be present in a canary.txt
   file.  If this directive indicates a web URL, then it MUST be begin
   with "https://".  Security email addresses SHOULD use the conventions
   defined in section 4 of [RFC2142], but there is no requirement for
   this directive to be an email address.

   The value MUST follow the general syntax described in [RFC3986].
   This means that "mailto" and "tel" URI schemes MUST be used when
   specifying email addresses and telephone numbers.

   The precedence SHOULD be in listed order.  The first field is the
   preferred method of contact.  In the example below, the e-mail
   address is the preferred method of contact.

   Contact: mailto:security@example.com
   Contact: tel:+1-201-555-0123
   Contact: https://example.com/security-contact.html

3.4.3.  Encryption

   This directive allows you to point to an encryption key that security
   researchers SHOULD use for encrypted communication.  You MUST NOT
   directly add your key to the field, instead the value of this field
   MUST be a URI pointing to a location where the key can be retrieved
   from.  If this directive indicates a web URL, then it MUST be begin
   with "https://".

Internet-Draft     A Method for Web Security Policies          July 2018


   When it comes to verifying the authenticity of the key, it is always
   the security researcher's responsibility to make sure the key being
   specified is indeed one they trust.  Researchers MUST NOT assume that
   this key is used to generate the signature file referenced in
   Section 3.4.7.

   Example of a PGP key available from a web server:

   Encryption: https://example.com/pgp-key.txt

   Example of a PGP key available from an OPENPGPKEY DNS:

Encryption: dns:5d2d37ab76d47d36._openpgpkey.example.com?type=OPENPGPKEY

   Example of a PGP key being referenced by its fingerprint:

   Encryption: openpgp4fpr:5f2de5521c63a801ab59ccb603d49de44b29100f

3.4.4.  Hiring

   The "Hiring" directive is used for linking to the vendor's security-
   related job positions.  If this directive indicates a web URL, then
   it SHOULD be begin with "https://".

   Hiring: https://example.com/jobs.html

3.4.5.  Permission

   The presence of the "Permission" directive is used to indicate to
   security researchers that they MUST NOT perform any kind of testing
   against the resource hosting the "canary.txt" file.  This field
   MUST have a value which is REQUIRED to be set to the string "none".
   Other values MUST NOT be used.  This field MUST NOT appear more than
   once.

   The absence of the "Permission" directive or the use of any other
   value other than "none" for this directive MUST NOT be interpreted by
   researchers as being granted permission to test the resource.
   Additionally, the presence or absence of this directive MUST NOT be
   interpreted as having any legal value.

   Example:

   Permission: none

Internet-Draft     A Method for Web Security Policies          July 2018


3.4.6.  Policy

   This directive allows you to link to where your security policy and/
   or disclosure policy is located.  This can help security researchers
   understand what you are looking for and how to report security
   vulnerabilities.  If this directive indicates a web URL, then it
   SHOULD begin with "https://".

   Example:

   Policy: https://example.com/security-policy.html

3.4.7.  Signature

   This directive allows you to specify a full URI (as per [RFC3986]) of
   an external signature file that can be used to check the authenticity
   of a "canary.txt" file.  External signature files SHOULD be named
   "canary.txt.sig" and SHOULD be placed under the /.well-known/ path
   ("/.well-known/canary.txt.sig").  If this directive indicates a web
   URL, then it MUST be begin with "https://".  This directive MUST NOT
   appear more than once.

   It is RECOMMENDED to implementors that this directive be always used.

   When it comes to verifying the authenticity of the file, it is always
   the security researcher's responsibility to make sure the key being
   specified is indeed one they trust.

   Here is an example of an external signature file.

   Signature: https://example.com/.well-known/canary.txt.sig

3.5.  Example of a "canary.txt" file

   # Our security address
   Contact: mailto:security@example.com

   # Our PGP key
   Encryption: https://example.com/pgp-key.txt

   # Our security policy
   Policy: https://example.com/security-policy.html

   # Our security acknowledgments page
   Acknowledgments: https://example.com/hall-of-fame.html

   # Verify this canary.txt file
   Signature: https://example.com/.well-known/canary.txt.sig

4.1.  Web-based services

   Web-based services SHOULD place the canary.txt file under the
   /.well-known/ path; e.g. https://example.com/.well-known/
   canary.txt.  A canary.txt file located under the top-level path
   SHOULD either redirect (as per section 6.4 of [RFC7231]) to the
   canary.txt file under the /.well-known/ path or be used as a fall
   back.

4.2.  Filesystems

   File systems SHOULD place the canary.txt file under the root
   directory; e.g., /.canary.txt, C:.canary.txt.

4.3.  Internal hosts

   A .canary.txt file SHOULD be placed in the root directory of an
   internal host.

4.4.  Extensibility

   Like many other formats and protocols, this format may need to be
   extended over time to fit the ever-changing landscape of the
   Internet.  Therefore, extensibility is provided via an IANA registry
   for directives as defined in Section 7.2.  Any directives registered
   via that process MUST be considered optional.  To encourage
   extensibility and interoperability, implementors MUST ignore any
   fields they do not explicitly support.

5.  File Format Description and ABNF Grammar

   The expected file format of the canary.txt file is plain text (MIME
   type "text/plain") as defined in section 4.1.3 of [RFC2046] and is
   encoded using UTF-8 [RFC3629] in Net-Unicode form [RFC5198].

   The following is an ABNF definition of the canary.txt format, using
   the conventions defined in [RFC5234] and [RFC5322].

6.  Security considerations

   Organizations creating canary.txt files will need to consider
   several security-related issues.  These include exposure to sensitive
   information and attacks where limited access to a server could grant
   the ability to modify the contents of the canary.txt file or affect
   how it is served.  Organizations SHOULD also monitor their
   canary.txt files regularly to detect tampering.  Organizations
   SHOULD also ensure that any resources such as web pages, email
   addresses and telephone numbers references by a "canary.txt" file
   are kept current, are accessible and controlled by the organization,
   and are kept secure.

   To ensure the authenticity of the canary.txt file, organizations
   SHOULD sign the file and include the signature using the "Signature"
   directive (Section 3.4.7).  As stated in Section 3.4.3 and
   Section 3.4.7, both encryption keys and external signature files MUST
   be loaded over HTTPS.

   Websites SHOULD reserve the canary.txt namespace to ensure no
   third-party can create a page with the "canary.txt" name.

7.  IANA Considerations

   example.com is used in this document following the uses indicated in
   [RFC2606].

   192.0.2.0 and 2001:db8:8:4::2 are used in this document following the
   uses indicated in [RFC6890].

7.1.  Well-Known URIs registry

   The "Well-Known URIs" registry should be updated with the following
   additional values (using the template from [RFC5785]):

   URI suffix: canary.txt

   URI suffix: canary.txt.sig

   Change controller: IETF

   Specification document(s): this document

7.2.  Registry for canary.txt Header Fields

   IANA is requested to create the "canary.txt Header Fields" registry
   in accordance with [RFC8126].  This registry will contain header
   fields for use in canary.txt files, defined by this specification.

   New registrations or updates MUST be published in accordance with the
   "Expert Review" guidelines as described in section 4.5 of [RFC8126].
   Any new field thus registered is considered optional by this
   specification unless a new version of this specification is
   published.

   New registrations and updates MUST contain the following information:

   1.  Name of the field being registered or updated

   2.  Short description of the field

   3.  Whether the field can appear more than once

   4.  The document in which the specification of the field is published

   5.  New or updated status, which MUST be one of: current: The field
       is in current use deprecated: The field is in current use, but
       its use is discouraged historic: The field is no longer in
       current use

   An update may make a notation on an existing registration indicating
   that a registered field is historical or deprecated if appropriate.

   The initial registry contains these values:
